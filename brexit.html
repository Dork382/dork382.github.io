            <h1>What is Brexit?</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Brexit is a portmanteau of the words "British" and "exit" coined to refer to
                the U.K.'s decision in a
                June 23, 2016
                referendum to leave the European Union (EU).1 Brexit took place at 11 p.m.
                In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom (UK) chose to leave the European Union (EU), a process
                known as Brexit
                (British Exit). Since that time, politicians have repeatedly tried to negotiate and approve a
                settlement agreement
                between the UK and EU that would lay out the terms of the UK’s exit.

            <h1>Which issues led to the Brexit vote in June 2016?</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The issues that led to the Brexit vote are numerous. (See chart on next
                page.) Some UK citizens,
                known as Brexit
                supporters, want the UK to leave the EU. Others, known as Remain supporters, want the UK to continue
                to be part of the
                EU. Voters in the United Kingdom had a chance to choose whether they wanted to leave the EU or
                remain a part of the EU
                in a referendum vote in June 2016. (A referendum is an opportunity for voters to decide an important
                issue through a
                popular vote.)
                On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the EU struck a provisional free-trade agreement that ensures the
                two sides can trade
                goods without tariffs or quotas. However, key details of the future relationship remain uncertain,
                such as trade in
                services, which make up 80% of the U.K. economy. This prevented a “no-deal” Brexit, which would have
                been significantly
                damaging to the U.K. economy. The was approved by the U.K. parliament, but still needs to be
                approved by the EU
                parliament. However the EU put the deal in place provisionally on January 1, 2021 for two months
                while its parliament
                scrutinizes and takes time to ratify it. While the deal allows tariff- and quota-free trade, U.K.-EU
                trade still faces
                customs checks, meaning commerce is not as smooth as when the U.K. was a member of the EU.

            <h1>Pros of Brexit for UK</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">⦁ Being part of the EU limits the UK’s international influence by excluding
                its presence as an
                independent member of the
                World Trade Organization (WTO).<br>
                ⦁ The UK would have more control over its laws and regulations, without the risk of losing national
                sovereignty due to
                top-down European policies.<br>
                ⦁ Some Brexit advocates believe Britain's national security could benefit from increased border
                controls.<br>
                ⦁ The membership fees to the European Union, in the order of billions of pounds, could be redirected
                and spent on
                services useful to the British population, for example as financing for the National Health Service
                (in English NHS).<br>
                ⦁ Brexit would allow the UK to gain more revenue from trading with other industrial powers, such as
                Japan, India and the
                US.<br>
                ⦁ Leaving the Union would free the United Kingdom from slow and inflexible bureaucratic processes,
                which have made the
                activity of small companies complex.<br>
                ⦁ With better trade deals and more selective immigration management, the UK labor market would have
                positive effects.

            <h1>Cons of Brexit for UK</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">⦁ Each year, European companies invested billions of pounds in the UK, in
                both the public and private
                sectors.<br>
                ⦁ As part of a community of 500 million people, Britain could have greater influence over
                international matters as a
                member of the EU.<br>
                ⦁ Access to the European market is invaluable in terms of commercial value and facilitates the
                exchange of goods,
                services and workforce between the various member countries.<br>
                ⦁ Free trade between EU countries reduces barriers and allows UK companies to grow steadily.<br>
                ⦁ Millions of people have been laid off. Some important sectors, such as nursing and manufacturing,
                have suffered a
                drastic collapse, due to the loss of qualified personnel.<br>
                ⦁ UK citizens lose hundreds of pounds each year due to EU VAT contributions and agricultural
                subsidies.<br>
                ⦁ A union better equips Britain to tackle threats to security, including terrorism and cross-border
                crime.<br>
                ⦁ The average person in Britain saves hundreds each year thanks to lower prices of goods and services
                facilitated by the
                EU.<br>
